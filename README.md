# DNA Sequencing Algorithms
Welcome to the repository for DNA sequencing algorithms! This collection of algorithms was developed as a programming assignment for the course "Algorithms for DNA Sequencing" offered by Johns Hopkins University on [Coursera] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-sequencing).

## Overview
In this repository, you will find implementations of various algorithms commonly used in DNA sequencing analysis. These algorithms play a crucial role in bioinformatics and genomics, aiding researchers in tasks such as sequence alignment, pattern matching, and identifying genetic variations.

The key algorithms included in this repository are:
- Boyer-Moore Algorithm: A string-searching algorithm that efficiently finds occurrences of a pattern within a larger text. It's particularly useful for its ability to skip comparisons by using information from the pattern itself.
- Naive Matching Algorithm: A simple pattern-matching algorithm that checks for the presence of a substring within a larger string by systematically comparing each character.
- Overlap Algorithm: Used for sequence assembly, this algorithm identifies overlapping regions between DNA sequences, which is essential for reconstructing the original genome.
- Edit Distance Algorithm: Also known as Levenshtein distance, this algorithm calculates the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one string into another. It's often used in DNA sequencing to measure the similarity between sequences or identify mutations.

## Skills Learned
Throughout the development of these algorithms, the following skills were acquired and reinforced:
- Algorithmic Thinking: Understanding and designing algorithms tailored to specific tasks in DNA sequencing.
- Pattern Matching Techniques: Implementing various pattern-matching strategies to efficiently search for sequences within larger datasets.
- Sequence Alignment: Learning methods to align DNA sequences, which is crucial for comparing genomes and identifying similarities or differences.
- Dynamic Programming: Utilizing dynamic programming approaches, such as in the edit distance algorithm, to solve complex sequence analysis problems optimally.
- Optimization Techniques: Employing optimization techniques to improve the efficiency and performance of algorithms, essential for handling large-scale genomic datasets.
